Hi, I'm Taufik — a Fullstack Explorer and Frontend Engineer who specializes in transforming data into beautiful visualizations and building interactive web experiences. I love crafting seamless experiences from pixels to APIs, and I'm passionate about teaching, mentoring, and continuous learning.<br><br>My core stack centers around JavaScript and TypeScript, with tools like Vue, Nuxt, React and Node.js. I focus on creating intuitive, data-driven interfaces that bring complex information to life and I'm always exploring new technologies to grow across the stack.
